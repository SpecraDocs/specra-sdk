Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. BRANDING / WATERMARK REQUIREMENT: All documentation sites generated using
   this Software MUST display the "Powered by Specra" watermark in a visible
   location (footer or equivalent) on every public-facing page. This watermark
   must include the text "Powered by Specra" and link to https://specra-docs.com.

   The watermark MUST NOT be removed, hidden, obscured, or made invisible by
   any means (including but not limited to CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation,
   or build-time stripping) unless the user holds an active paid subscription
   (Starter tier or above) on the Specra platform (https://specra-docs.com)
   that explicitly grants the right to remove Specra branding.

   Removal, hiding, or circumvention of the watermark without a valid paid
   subscription constitutes a COPYRIGHT VIOLATION and a breach of this license,
   and may result in legal action.

3. Users with an active paid subscription (Starter, Pro, or Enterprise) on the
   Specra platform may remove the watermark by setting the appropriate
   configuration option. This right is non-transferable and applies only while
   the subscription remains active. If a subscription lapses or is cancelled,
   the watermark must be restored.
